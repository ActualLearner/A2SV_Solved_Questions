#
# input: two arrays
# output: bool 
#
#
# problem: given two arrays, determine if b is a subset of a
# - b is a subset of a means: every element of b is an element
# of a, but not necessarily vice versa.
#
# EDGECASES:
# -if b has duplicates, then a must have them for b to be a subset of a.
#
# Approach 1
# - Initialize a set of a
# - Loop through each element of b
# - Lookup that element in set a
# - If that element isn't found, return False.
# - At the end, return True
#
#
# Approach 2
# - Initialize two hashmaps
# - Count each elements freq in both arrays
# - Loop through each key in hashmap_b
# - Compare the key's value in hashmap_b & hashmap_a
# - If the value in hashmap_b > value in hashmap_a return false
# - At the end, return True
#
# time => O(n) since we're looping once for each hashmap
# space => O(n) since we're using two hashmaps
# space may be less than O(n) because we are not adding duplicates 
#

        for num in b:
            hashmap_b[num] = hashmap_b.get(num, 0) + 1
            
        for key in hashmap_b:
            if hashmap_b[key] > hashmap_a[key]:
                return False
        
        return True
