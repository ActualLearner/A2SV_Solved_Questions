    def findUnion(self, a, b):
        # 
        # input: two arrays
        # output: array
        # 
        # Problem: you're given two arrays, 
        # return their union/concatentation
        
        # - Order of combining them doesn't matter
        #
        # Approach 1
        # - Concatentate both arrays
        # - use list & set to remove duplicate
        # 
        # time => O(n) since set & list process each element
        # space => O(1) since we're not using variables
        #
